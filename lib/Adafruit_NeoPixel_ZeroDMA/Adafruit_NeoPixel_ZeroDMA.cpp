/*
DMA NeoPixel library for M0-based boards (Feather M0, Arduino Zero, etc.).
Doesn't require stopping interrupts, so millis()/micros() don't lose time,
soft PWM (for servos, etc.) still operate normally, etc.
THIS IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS AND NOT 100% THERE YET.

THIS ONLY WORKS ON CERTAIN PINS.  THIS IS NORMAL.  Library uses SERCOM
peripherals for SPI output, and the hardware only supports this on
specific pins (plus, some SERCOMs are in use for Serial, I2C, etc.).
See example sketch for explanation.

0/1 bit timing does not precisely match NeoPixel/WS2812/SK6812 datasheet
specs, but it seems to work well enough.  Use at your own peril.

Currently this only supports strip declaration with length & pin known at
compile time, so it's not a 100% drop-in replacement for all NeoPixel code
right now.  But probably 99%+ of all sketches are written that way, so it's
perfectly usable for most.  The stock NeoPixel library has the option of
setting the length & pin number at run-time (so these can be stored in a
config file or in EEPROM)...this is entirely possible here, just hasn't
been written yet.  In that regard, TO DO:
setPin(uint8_t p)
updateLength(uint16_t n)
updateType(neoPixelType t)

Have not tested this yet with multiple instances (DMA-driven NeoPixels on
multiple pins), but in theory it should work.  Should also be OK mixing
DMA and non-DMA NeoPixels in same sketch (just use different constructor
and pins for each).

/*
This table contains the available pins and their corresponding SERCOMs and
DMA-related registers and such.  M0 can actually handle SPI DMA on more
pins than are indicated here, but the code design INTENTIONALLY limits it
to specific pins.  This is not a technical limit, but a documentation issue.
There are usually multiple pins available for each SERCOM, but each SERCOM
can have only one active MOSI pin.  Rather than try to document "If you use
in X, then pins Y and Z can't be used" (and repeating this explanation for
up to four SERCOMs, and that the specific pins can vary for each board),
it's 10,000X SIMPLER to explain and use if one specific pin has been
preselected for each SERCOM.  I tried to pick pins that are nicely spaced
around the board and don't knock out other vital peripherals.  SERCOM pin
selection is NOT a fun process, believe me, it's much easier this way...

  // 2.4 MHz, the 3:1 sizing then creates NeoPixel-like 800 KHz bitrate.
  // The extra 90 bytes is the low-level latch at the end of the NeoPixel
  // data stream.  When idle, SPI logic level is normally HIGH, we need
  // LOW for latch.  There is no invert option.  Various tricks like
  // switching the pin to a normal LOW output at end of data don't quite
  // work, there's still small glitches.  So, solution here is to keep
  // the SPI DMA transfer in an endless loop...it actually issues the
  // NeoPixel data over and over again forever (this doesn't cost us
